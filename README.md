# BT Text

What is this project?
------
Code for NRV is collaborating with Blacksburg Transit to improve their SMS (texting) and IVR (interactive voice response) systems. While they currently use an in-house solution to provide responses to users that text and call to receive current bus arrival status, they wanted to explore the option of using a third-party service. [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) is one of the more popular services offering both SMS and IVR in a REST-based API. This project is the development against that API to provide responses to users of BT.
* Built using Python and [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)

Status
------
Currently a work in progress with no deployment

A single endpoint for SMS replies has been created and works with out any error handling currently implemented.
